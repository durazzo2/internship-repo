# README: What I'm Still Figuring Out as an Engineer

I’ve made solid progress as a software engineer, especially when it comes to understanding operating systems and working collaboratively. But I know there are still areas where I can grow. This README is a reflection of the skills and habits I’m actively working to improve.

---

## System Design & Architecture

This is the area I’m most focused on right now. While I’ve built several small-to-mid-sized applications, I haven’t had much experience designing software with long-term scalability, modularity, or maintenance in mind.

**Goals:**
- Learn about real-world system architectures and design trade-offs.
- Understand and apply common patterns like layered architecture, event-driven systems, and domain-driven design.
- Refactor past projects with clearer separation of responsibilities.

---

## Testing

I understand the basics of writing unit tests and have some experience using tools like JUnit. However, I still don't test consistently in personal projects, and I want to build better habits around writing and organizing tests—especially integration and edge-case scenarios.

**Goals:**
- Write meaningful tests earlier in the development process.
- Learn mocking frameworks and improve test coverage on real projects.
- Make testing a natural part of building, not an afterthought.

---

## Learning Strategy

I’m naturally curious and love to explore different technologies and concepts, but sometimes I jump between topics without going deep enough. I want to be more deliberate and structured in how I learn.

**Goals:**
- Focus on one topic at a time—currently, that’s system design.
- Maintain a weekly learning log to track progress.
- Apply what I learn by building real or small-scale projects.

---

## Collaboration

Collaboration is one of my strengths. I communicate well in teams, enjoy helping others, and have received good feedback for being approachable and proactive in group settings.

**Still improving:**
- Write clearer documentation and commit messages.
- Provide thoughtful, helpful code reviews.

---

## Systems Knowledge

I have a solid understanding of operating systems and enjoy digging into how things work at a low level. This background helps me think more deeply about performance, efficiency, and system behavior when writing higher-level code.

**Goals:**
- Continue learning by reading systems-level books and experimenting with low-level projects.
- Apply OS knowledge in architectural decisions when relevant.

## Summary

| Area                  | Current Level | Focus Level | Goals |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| System Design         | Beginner       | High         | Study, refactor, design intentionally |
| Testing               | Intermediate   | Medium       | Build habit, learn advanced techniques |
| Learning Structure    | Needs work     | High         | Focused learning, weekly progress |
| Collaboration         | Strong         | Ongoing      | Improve communication and reviews |
| Operating Systems     | Solid          | Medium       | Deepen and apply practically |

This README is a snapshot of where I am and where I’m heading. I’ll revisit it regularly to keep myself accountable and to stay focused on growing as a well-rounded engineer.
